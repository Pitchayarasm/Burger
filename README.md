   1.The user inputs name of the burger they would like to eat and "click" submit button. (If the user does not input anything, it will alert "Please input a burger name"
   
   2.The Burger name will appear at the left in the current order side, the user then can either cancle or devour the burger. 
      If the user chooses to devour, the burger name will move to "eat burger side".
      If the user chooses to cancle, the burger name will diappear from current order side.
